#Remote File System plug-in for Netbeans

Allows editing files on remote file systems e.g. FTP, SFTP, etc. This plugin is based on remotefs project in contrib repository of netbeans. I decided to rewrite some parts because it was coupled with FTP implementation. I also added SFTP file system support. Now API is decoupled and ready to write implementation for any file system.

This project was migrated from https://kenai.com/projects/nb-remotefs
